Deployment: updates and Rollback

Rollout & versioning:

When you first create a deploy, it triggers a rollout
a new rollout creates a new deploy revision i.e, revision 1

in future when application is upgraded container version is upgraded to a new one
a new rollout deployed and new deploy revision is created i.e, revision 2

this helps us to keep track of changes made on deployment & enables us to rollback to prev version of deploy if necessary


#kubectl rollout status deploy/name

#kubectl rollout history deploy/name ==> to see the revision & history of control

Deployment Strategy:

Recreate Strategy:

Application will be down & new updated app pods will be created

Rolling Update stategy: default deploy strategy

we take older version down & bring newer version up one by one which requires no downtime

if you dont specify a strategy while creating deployment it will assume as rolling update strategy

#ku apply -f deploy.yaml

#ku set image deploy/name nginx=nginx:1.1

in rolling update strategy initially a deployment consists of a replicaset
and when you are upgrading version of the app it will create a new replicaset and one by one delete the pod in old "rs" 
and creates pod in new "rs".

rollback:

#ku rollout undo deploy/deploy_name
