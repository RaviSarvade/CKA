Scheduling in kubernetes:

Manual Scheduling: 

Generally Scheduler will check for spec.nodeName in the pod definition file if its not present then it will schedule the pod in appropriate node
or we can manually mention the node details in nodeName field

- if scheduler is not present then Pod status will be in Pending state or you can manually assign pod to the nodes
- at the time of pod creation you can mention nodename property in pod.yml in spec.nodeName
- for existing pod whose status is pending beacuse it is wating for teh node to assign then you have to create a binding object yml and then send post request binding API
with binding data in json format
- you cant edit the nodeName of a pod in live environment

Labels and Selectors: --> used for grouping and filtering the objects
---------------------

Labels - are properties attached to each item
selectors - used to filter these item

#ku get po --selector app=app1

in order to connect replica sets to pod we can config selector field

a single label can do if it matches correctly
if you specify multiple labels then pod will be assigned to replicasets consisting of those multiple labels

Annotations: used to record othe details of info pupose - tool , build, contact,e mail details
metadata.annotations

Taints & Tolerations: it wont deals with security and intrusions

it discuss about pod to Node relations

are used to set restrictions on what pod to be scheduled to a node

taints are set on nodes and tolerations are set to pods

Taint-Node

#kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

we have three taint-effects i.e, what happens to pods that do not tolerate to taints
NoSchedule | PreferNoSchedule | NoExecute
