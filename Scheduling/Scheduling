Scheduling in kubernetes:

Manual Scheduling: 

Generally Scheduler will check for spec.nodeName in the pod definition file if its not present then it will schedule the pod in appropriate node
or we can manually mention the node details in nodeName field

- if scheduler is not present then Pod status will be in Pending state or you can manually assign pod to the nodes
- at the time of pod creation you can mention nodename property in pod.yml in spec.nodeName
- for existing pod whose status is pending beacuse it is wating for teh node to assign then you have to create a binding object yml and then send post request binding API
with binding data in json format
- you cant edit the nodeName of a pod in live environment
