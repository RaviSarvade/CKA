Monitoring K8s cluster
===========================

To monitor resource consumption at node level i.e, how many are healthy & performance metrics such as cpu, memory,disk & network utilization

Pod level metrics:
no of pods, cpu & memory

K8s has no builtin feature monitoring solution

kubelet agent contains cAdvisor --> responsible for receiving performance metrics from the pod & exposing them to kubelet api to make metrics available for metrics server
#kubectl top node/pod
